The emergence of Large Language Models (LLMs) provides previously unattainable cognitive capabilities for solving complex problems. However, when applying them to high-risk, dynamic physical world decision-making, a fundamental ``cognitive-physical gap'' exists. This gap manifests as three core technical challenges: the ``reality grounding'' problem where LLMs struggle to accurately understand multimodal, structured data from physical systems; the ``model utilization'' problem where they cannot effectively invoke and orchestrate complex physical simulation models; and the ``safe execution'' problem where they fail to coordinate their slow reasoning with the rapid, safe response requirements of the physical world.

To systematically address these challenges, a doctoral research plan has been formulated, centered on conceptualizing and designing a new Agent architecture named CORTEX. The theoretical foundation of this work is a novel ``three-tier digital twin decision framework.'' This framework categorizes physical decision tasks by complexity evolution into three levels: L1-Descriptive Twins (for diagnostic decisions), L2-Predictive Twins (for strategic decisions), and L3-Interactive Twins (for action-oriented decisions). This framework not only provides logical justification for CORTEX architecture design but also constructs a standardized ``capability testing ground'' for subsequent empirical evaluation.

The CORTEX architecture directly responds to the three challenges through deep extensions of existing paradigms. Its ``Perception Module'' employs a novel Digital Twin Retrieval-Augmented Generation (DT-RAG) mechanism to address reality grounding; its ``Reasoning Module'' encapsulates complex physical models as LLM-callable tools to address model utilization; and its ``Action Module'' designs a ``slow-fast dual-loop'' safety coordinator to address safe execution.

The effectiveness of this architecture will be rigorously evaluated through a series of representative cases. The evaluation centers on quantifying a metric called ``Cognitive Gain'' to measure the performance improvement CORTEX brings compared to the best traditional methods in the field. Three case studies map to L1, L2, and L3 levels respectively: structural health diagnosis of buildings at L1 level, cancer treatment strategy planning based on tumor microenvironment twins at L2 level, and autonomous UAV exploration in unknown environments at L3 level.

Ultimately, this doctoral research aims to deliver a thoroughly validated, scalable architectural blueprint, laying the foundation for future development of powerful next-generation artificial intelligence systems capable of advanced reasoning and reliable action in complex, dynamic physical worlds.
