\chapter{Case Study III: Autonomous Task Planning for UAVs} \label{chp:uav}

This chapter validates the CORTEX architecture's L3 Interactive Twins capabilities through autonomous UAV reconnaissance in GPS-denied environments, demonstrating real-time decision-making under safety-critical constraints.

\section{Domain and Mission Objectives}

\subsection{GPS-Denied UAV Reconnaissance}

The UAV must perform autonomous reconnaissance in post-disaster scenarios where GPS signals are unavailable due to infrastructure damage. The operational challenge involves navigating unknown terrain, avoiding dynamic obstacles, and maximizing area coverage while maintaining safety as the highest priority.

\subsection{L3 Interactive Twins Requirements}

L3 environments demand real-time bidirectional interaction with immediate physical consequences. Key characteristics include 100-200ms decision cycles, closed-loop feedback where UAV actions affect environment state, dynamic obstacles, sensor uncertainties, and safety criticality where errors can result in mission failure.

\subsection{Research Hypothesis}

\emph{H3}: CORTEX's dual-loop coordination mechanism can achieve higher task efficiency while maintaining safety compared to traditional planning approaches, providing better exploration coverage and fewer safety incidents in GPS-denied reconnaissance scenarios.

\section{Interactive Twin Design and CORTEX Configuration}

\subsection{Dual-Loop Architecture Mapping}

The slow loop operates at 1-5 second intervals for high-level mission planning, strategic path planning, and risk assessment. The fast loop operates at 100-200ms intervals for real-time obstacle avoidance, immediate safety responses, and sensor data processing.

\subsection{Interactive Digital Twin Environment}

The digital twin employs Unity-based simulation with realistic physics, dynamic weather, procedurally generated terrain, and dynamic obstacle generation. Three complexity levels range from open terrain (Map 1) to dense urban areas with damaged infrastructure (Map 3).

\subsection{CORTEX Configuration}

The complete architecture integrates real-time 3D SLAM, GPT-4 based strategic reasoning with aviation domain adaptation, dual-loop coordination with safety validation, and continuous performance optimization.

\section{Implementation and Validation}

\subsection{Implementation Plan}

Phase 1 involves completing the simulation framework with environment complexity enhancements and sensor realism improvements. Phase 2 focuses on CORTEX integration including perception module integration and LLM strategic reasoning. Phase 3 conducts experimental validation against RRT*+DWA baselines.

\subsection{Experimental Design}

Evaluation metrics include area coverage rate, mission completion time, safety events count, and intelligence quality. Statistical validation involves 10 trials per complexity level with significance testing.

\subsection{Expected Results and Cognitive Gains}

CORTEX is expected to demonstrate 25-40\% improvement in coverage rate, 80-90\% reduction in safety incidents, and 15-30\% reduction in mission completion time through strategic planning and proactive risk assessment.

\subsection{Technical Challenges and Solutions}

Key challenges include real-time performance constraints, dual-loop coordination complexity, and environmental uncertainty. Solutions involve reasoning caching, hierarchical decision architecture, and robust uncertainty quantification.

\section{Summary of Findings}

The UAV case study validates the L3 Interactive Twins layer and demonstrates the complete CORTEX architecture under demanding conditions. Expected cognitive gains validate the architecture's effectiveness for safety-critical applications, establishing new paradigms for autonomous system design that combine deliberative reasoning with reactive control through hierarchical coordination mechanisms.
