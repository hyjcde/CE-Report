\section{Research Background: The Rise of LLM-driven Autonomous Agents}

In the third decade of the 21st century, the field of Artificial Intelligence (AI) is undergoing a paradigm revolution, catalyzed by the advent and proliferation of Foundation Models \cite{bommasani2021opportunities}, with Large Language Models (LLMs) at their vanguard. This transformation did not occur in a vacuum; it stands on the shoulders of decades of progress in deep learning. While earlier architectures like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) mastered perceptual tasks in vision \cite{krizhevsky2012imagenet} and Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) tackled sequential data, they each faced inherent limitations. RNNs, for instance, struggled with capturing long-range dependencies in text, a critical bottleneck for genuine language understanding. The decisive technical breakthrough arrived with the Transformer architecture, introduced in 2017. Its core innovation, the self-attention mechanism, enabled models to weigh the significance of every word in a sequence relative to all other words, facilitating a parallelizable and holistic understanding of context, thereby shattering the previous constraints of sequential processing \cite{vaswani2017attention}.

Building upon this architectural foundation, a new generation of models emerged. By scaling up the number of parameters into the hundreds of billions and training on unprecedented volumes of web-scale text and code corpora, models like OpenAI's Generative Pre-trained Transformer (GPT) series \cite{brown2020language, openai2023gpt4}, Meta AI's LLaMA \cite{touvron2023llama}, and Google's PaLM \cite{chowdhery2022palm} began to exhibit remarkable emergent properties. These were not explicitly programmed but arose as a consequence of scale: the ability for in-context learning, where a model adapts its behavior based on a few examples in its prompt; and the capacity for complex reasoning, exemplified by techniques like Chain-of-Thought (CoT) prompting, which elicits step-by-step reasoning pathways to solve problems \cite{wei2022chain}. The result is a class of models that function less like specialized tools and more like general-purpose cognitive engines, possessing a vast, albeit passive, repository of world knowledge and an impressive faculty for reasoning. This marks a definitive shift in AI, from an era of task-specific perceptual intelligence to one of generalized cognitive intelligence.

The logical and immediate ambition following this breakthrough was to galvanize these passive cognitive engines into active, goal-directed participants in the digital world. This gave rise to the burgeoning field of Autonomous Agents powered by LLMs \cite{xi2023rise}. The central concept is a paradigm shift in human-computer interaction: instead of writing explicit code for every action, a user can specify a high-level goal in natural language, and the agent, using an LLM as its core reasoning module, autonomously devises and executes a plan to achieve it. Pioneering frameworks demonstrated how to orchestrate this process. The ReAct framework, for example, established a powerful synergy between reasoning and acting, where the LLM iteratively generates verbal reasoning traces to inform its next action (e.g., calling an external tool) and uses the outcome of that action to refine its subsequent reasoning \cite{yao2022react}. Concurrently, research on tool-augmented LLMs, such as Toolformer \cite{schick2023toolformer}, WebGPT \cite{nakano2021webgpt}, and more recent work on AutoGPT \cite{richards2023autogpt} and LangChain \cite{chase2022langchain}, showed that LLMs could not only be given tools but could even teach themselves how and when to use them, such as invoking a calculator for precise arithmetic or querying a search engine for up-to-date information. These developments have created a new "agentic" programming paradigm, enabling the automation of complex digital workflows and heralding a new era of productivity in the information economy.

This powerful agentic paradigm finds its ultimate and most challenging application in the domain of Embodied AI, where agents must perceive, reason, and act directly within the dynamic, unstructured, and unforgiving physical world \cite{duan2022survey}. The potential impact is transformative across numerous sectors. In industrial automation and logistics, an embodied agent could go beyond the rigid programming of current robotics. It could, for instance, visually inspect a product on a conveyor belt, identify a novel defect, reason about its potential cause, and dynamically reprogram its own robotic arm to safely set the item aside, all without human intervention \cite{ahn2022can, brohan2023rt2}. In smart infrastructure management, as this thesis will explore, an agent could fuse static architectural data (like a Building Information Model) with live data streams from thousands of IoT sensors, creating a holistic understanding of a building's health to predict failures and autonomously schedule preventative maintenance. In scientific exploration, an autonomous drone powered by an LLM could be tasked with "surveying this area for signs of geological stress"; it would then need to autonomously plan its flight path, decide which sensor modalities to activate, and interpret the incoming data in real-time to guide its subsequent exploration \cite{vemprala2023chatgpt, liu2023llm}. These scenarios represent the grand vision of AI: systems that do not merely process information about the world, but actively and intelligently participate in it.

\section{Core Problem Statement: The Decision-Making Gap in Complex Physical Systems}

Despite the remarkable capabilities of LLMs in processing and generating text-based knowledge, a fundamental challenge emerges when these systems are tasked with making decisions in complex, dynamic physical environments. The nature of this challenge extends beyond simple task execution—it concerns the very foundation of how intelligent decisions are made when dealing with systems that exhibit continuous change, multi-scale interactions, and emergent behaviors.

Consider the complexity inherent in managing a modern building's health. Such a system involves thousands of interconnected components—structural elements, mechanical systems, environmental controls, and sensing networks—all operating within a continuously evolving physical context influenced by weather patterns, occupancy loads, aging processes, and external disturbances. Traditional decision-making approaches rely on either human expertise, which cannot scale to handle the data complexity and temporal demands, or rule-based systems, which become brittle when faced with novel situations or complex interdependencies. The question that emerges is: how can we enable sophisticated reasoning about such systems while maintaining awareness of their dynamic, interconnected nature?

The challenge is fundamentally rooted in what cognitive scientists have long identified as the Symbol Grounding Problem \cite{harnad1990symbol, searle1980minds}—the difficulty of connecting abstract symbolic representations to meaningful relationships in the physical world. For complex decision-making systems, this manifests as a series of critical gaps:

\textbf{The Representation-Reality Gap}: Current AI systems operate on static snapshots of information, while physical systems exist in continuous flux. A building's structural condition, for instance, changes moment by moment due to thermal effects, load variations, and material aging. Decision-making based on outdated or incomplete representations of such systems inevitably leads to suboptimal or potentially dangerous outcomes. The challenge is not merely having more data, but maintaining coherent, up-to-date representations of complex system states that can support sophisticated reasoning processes.

\textbf{The Temporal Reasoning Challenge}: Physical systems exhibit behaviors across multiple temporal scales—from microsecond vibrations to decade-long degradation processes. Effective decision-making requires the ability to reason across these scales simultaneously, understanding how immediate actions might influence long-term system evolution, and how historical patterns inform current states. Traditional approaches struggle to maintain this temporal coherence while processing the volume and complexity of modern sensor data streams.

\textbf{The Multi-Scale Interaction Problem}: In complex physical systems, local phenomena often have global implications, and system-wide changes manifest through intricate cascades of local effects. A small crack in a building's facade might indicate deeper structural issues, thermal bridge problems, or water infiltration patterns that could affect the entire building envelope. Current decision-making frameworks lack the ability to dynamically model and reason about these multi-scale interactions in real-time.

\textbf{The Context-Action Coupling Dilemma}: Physical world decisions are inherently contextual—the same action can have vastly different consequences depending on current system state, environmental conditions, and historical context. Moreover, the act of making a decision itself changes the system state, creating a dynamic coupling between reasoning and reality that traditional static analysis cannot capture. This coupling requires decision-making systems that can maintain awareness of how their own actions modify the very context in which future decisions must be made.

\textbf{The Uncertainty and Risk Propagation Challenge}: Physical systems operate under various forms of uncertainty—measurement noise, model approximations, unpredictable environmental factors, and incomplete knowledge of system parameters. Effective decision-making must not only account for these uncertainties but understand how they propagate through the system and compound over time. The challenge is developing reasoning processes that can make sound decisions while explicitly acknowledging and managing these uncertainties.

These challenges point to a fundamental need for decision-making architectures that can maintain coherent, dynamic representations of complex physical systems while enabling sophisticated reasoning about their behavior, evolution, and optimal management. The solution requires bridging the gap between symbolic reasoning capabilities and the continuous, interconnected nature of physical reality—a bridge that must be both technically feasible and practically deployable across diverse domains and scales of complexity.

The key insight driving this research is that effective decision-making in complex physical systems requires more than just better algorithms or more data—it requires a fundamental rethinking of how artificial intelligence systems represent, reason about, and interact with dynamic physical reality. This challenge demands architectures that can seamlessly integrate symbolic reasoning with continuous world modeling, enabling decisions that are both scientifically grounded and practically effective.

\section{Theoretical Perspective: Connection to the Symbol Grounding Problem}

The challenges faced by LLMs in physical world interaction can be understood through the lens of the Symbol Grounding Problem, first articulated by Stevan Harnad in 1990 \cite{harnad1990symbol}. This fundamental problem in cognitive science asks: How can the semantic interpretation of a formal symbol system be made intrinsic to the system, rather than just parasitic on the meanings in our heads? In the context of LLMs, this translates to: How can the statistical patterns learned from text be given genuine meaning that connects to the physical world?

Traditional approaches to symbol grounding in robotics have focused on direct sensorimotor experience—the idea that symbols acquire meaning through direct interaction with the physical world \cite{cangelosi2010integration}. However, this approach faces scalability challenges when applied to complex, real-world scenarios. The physical world is vast and complex, and direct experience alone cannot provide the breadth of knowledge necessary for intelligent behavior in novel situations.

Recent work in multimodal learning has shown promise in bridging this gap by training models on both textual and visual data \cite{radford2021learning, alayrac2022flamingo}. However, these approaches still face limitations when it comes to dynamic, interactive environments where the state of the world changes continuously based on the agent's actions and external factors.

The approach proposed in this thesis takes a different perspective: rather than relying solely on direct sensorimotor experience or static multimodal training, we propose using Digital Twins as a bridge between symbolic knowledge and physical reality. Digital Twins provide a computationally tractable way to ground symbolic reasoning in dynamic, physics-aware representations of the physical world.

\section{Proposed Solution: The CORTEX Cognitive Architecture}

To address these fundamental challenges, this thesis proposes the development and validation of CORTEX (Cognitive Reasoning and Task EXecution architecture), a novel cognitive architecture that fundamentally reframes the role of LLMs in physical world interaction. Rather than treating LLMs as standalone reasoning engines, CORTEX positions them as cognitive cores that are intrinsically dependent on dynamic world representations for effective decision-making.

The key innovation of CORTEX lies in its integration of Digital Twins (DTs) as the primary vehicle for world representation. We define a Digital Twin functionally as any computational model that dynamically represents a physical system with a level of fidelity sufficient to support the decision-making needs of the task at hand. This broad definition encompasses various forms of representation, from high-fidelity 3D geometric models to abstract feature-space representations, allowing the architecture to adapt to different domains and requirements.

The CORTEX architecture operates through a cognitive science-inspired, four-stage loop:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{Perceptual Grounding \& Context Formulation}: The LLM queries the Digital Twin to understand the current state of the physical system, grounding its reasoning in up-to-date, physically-meaningful representations.
    
    \item \textbf{Causal Inference \& Predictive Simulation}: The LLM manipulates the Digital Twin to explore potential future states and consequences of different actions, enabling forward-looking decision-making.
    
    \item \textbf{Action Policy Generation \& Validation}: The LLM generates and validates action policies by testing them within the Digital Twin environment before execution in the physical world.
    
    \item \textbf{Physical Interaction \& Model Calibration}: Feedback from the physical world is used to continuously update and calibrate the Digital Twin, ensuring that the world representation remains aligned with reality.
\end{enumerate}

This architecture addresses the core limitations of current LLM-based agents by providing a dynamic, physics-aware representation that can be continuously updated and queried. The Digital Twin serves as a bridge between the abstract symbolic reasoning of the LLM and the concrete physical reality of the task environment.
