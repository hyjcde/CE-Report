\section{Problem Background and Decision-Making Challenges}

\subsection{Building Health Monitoring Landscape}

Building defect management faces significant challenges in handling evolving defects across complex urban structures. In contemporary urbanization processes, buildings serve as core carriers of human activity, with their safety and functionality directly related to social stability and development. However, as time progresses, buildings inevitably face issues of aging and wear. According to recent statistical data, over 50\% of private residences experience varying degrees of structural problems after 30 years of use \cite{spencer2019advances}. These issues range from surface cracks to severe structural defects, affecting not only building aesthetics and comfort but potentially endangering user safety \cite{zhang2023automated}.

Traditional building defect management has evolved through different data governance paradigms. Document-based approaches, relying on inspection reports, maintenance logs, and repair records, suffer from unstructured information organization and limited searchability. Model-based methods, leveraging Building Information Models (BIMs) and Geographic Information Systems (GIS), provide better structure but lack flexibility in handling dynamic defect information and complex semantic relationships \cite{li2024single}. Both approaches struggle with the temporal nature of defect evolution and the complex interdependencies between different building components.

\subsection{Decision-Making Challenges in Building Maintenance}

The unique characteristics of building defects pose specific challenges for information management. Defects are inherently dynamic, evolving over time with varying progression patterns. They exhibit complex spatial-temporal relationships, where one defect may influence or indicate potential issues in other building components. Traditional defect modeling approaches often fail to capture these dynamic relationships and evolution patterns effectively \cite{wang2023augmented}.

Furthermore, the interpretation and assessment of defects require extensive domain expertise, making it difficult to standardize the evaluation process. The challenges include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Reactive vs. Predictive Paradigms}: Most current systems operate reactively, addressing defects after they become apparent rather than predicting their occurrence
    \item \textbf{Multi-scale Temporal Considerations}: Defects evolve over different time scales, from immediate environmental responses to long-term structural degradation
    \item \textbf{Spatial Correlation Dependencies}: Understanding how defects in one area may affect or indicate problems in other building regions
    \item \textbf{Resource Optimization}: Balancing cost, safety, and performance considerations in maintenance scheduling
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Requirements for Intelligent Building Health Management}

With the advent of Industry 4.0, emerging technologies have provided new possibilities for addressing these challenges. The requirements for next-generation building health management systems include:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Real-time Monitoring}: Continuous surveillance capabilities with early warning systems for critical defects
    \item \textbf{Predictive Analytics}: Advanced algorithms capable of forecasting defect evolution and failure probabilities
    \item \textbf{Automated Decision-making}: Intelligent systems capable of generating maintenance recommendations without constant human oversight
    \item \textbf{System Integration}: Seamless compatibility with existing building management systems and workflows
\end{itemize}

\section{DefectGPT Framework: BIM-IoT Fusion Architecture}

To address the challenges identified above, we developed DefectGPT, a comprehensive framework integrating UAV inspection, BIM, and GIS into a Digital Twin environment. This framework represents the first implementation of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) in building defect management, where domain-specific knowledge retrieval guides Large Language Models to generate compliance-aware recommendations.

\subsection{Digital Twin Construction with Multi-Source Data Integration}

The DefectGPT framework implements a three-layer architecture comprising the Data Layer, the Digital Twin Layer, and the Decision Layer. This structure enables sophisticated data management and real-time synchronization between physical buildings and their digital counterparts.

\subsubsection{Data Layer Components}

The Data Layer incorporates three primary components:

\textbf{GeoBIM Modeling}: Combines multiple data sources including 3D mesh models, BIM models, GIS information, and geo-AI knowledge bases. This integration follows established frameworks for spatial data management while providing enhanced semantic understanding of building components.

\textbf{Defect Modeling}: Processes aerial photographs of building facades using advanced detection algorithms to identify RGB defects, infrared anomalies, and defect classifications. The system performs precise defect localization, determining global positions, local coordinates, and characteristic defect features.

\textbf{Expert Knowledge Integration}: Leverages inspection reports, technical standards, legal frameworks, and defect manuals to enrich defect data with domain-specific insights.

\subsubsection{Digital Twin Layer Architecture}

The Digital Twin Layer serves as the core of the digital representation, implementing three distinct data carriers:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Spatial Information Carriers}: Handle formats such as IFC, RVT, and KML, ensuring proper management of spatial data and geometric relationships
    \item \textbf{Defect Data Schemas}: Standardized storage formats (XML, JSON, CSV, database) ensuring seamless compatibility with retrieval workflows
    \item \textbf{Domain Knowledge Repositories}: Comprehensive storage of expert knowledge in various formats (PDF, DOCX, Markdown)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{UAV-Based Data Acquisition and Processing}

Unmanned Aerial Vehicle technology provides the primary data acquisition mechanism for the DefectGPT system. UAVs equipped with high-resolution cameras and thermal sensors execute standardized flight trajectories to ensure uniform coverage of building facades.

\subsubsection{Defect Detection and Classification}

The system employs advanced computer vision algorithms to identify and classify different types of building defects:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Surface Cracks}: Identified through edge detection algorithms and characterized by width, length, and orientation
    \item \textbf{Spalling Areas}: Detected through texture analysis and color variance, with dimensions and severity assessment
    \item \textbf{Water Infiltration}: Identified through thermal imaging and moisture detection, with seepage intensity evaluation
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Spatial Registration and Localization}

Defect localization begins with UAV-based inspections capturing high-resolution images of building facades. Using RTK (Real-Time Kinematic) positioning, the UAV's pose is accurately determined, ensuring precise alignment between captured images and the 3D BIM model. The coordinate transformation process involves:

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Depth estimation from UAV position to building facade
    \item Pose estimation and orientation calculation
    \item Tangential vector adjustments for facade surface alignment
    \item Global coordinate transformation from image coordinates to world coordinates
\end{enumerate}

\section{CORTEX Implementation for Building Health Management}

    \item \textbf{Historical Inspection Layer}: Archived reports, maintenance records, and temporal defect data
    \item \textbf{Real-time Data Layer}: Current information from ongoing inspections, sensor readings, and Digital Twin updates
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Context-Aware Retrieval Process}

The retrieval system employs advanced algorithms that consider both explicit queries and contextual information:

\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Multi-dimensional Indexing}: Information categorized by defect types, locations, severity levels, timestamps, and building components
    \item \textbf{Semantic Search Capabilities}: Natural language processing enabling intuitive query formulation
    \item \textbf{Dynamic Knowledge Graph}: Representing relationships between defects, causative factors, inspection procedures, and maintenance actions
