\chapter{Case Study II: Medical Ultrasound Diagnosis} \label{chp:medical}

This chapter proposes a comprehensive validation of the CORTEX architecture in the medical domain, focusing on ultrasound diagnosis as a representative case of non-spatial Digital Twin applications. The case study demonstrates how the CORTEX framework can be adapted beyond geometric representations to support sophisticated reasoning about complex physiological systems.

\section{Clinical Decision-Making Challenges}

Medical ultrasound serves as one of the most widely used imaging modalities in modern healthcare across cardiology, obstetrics, emergency medicine, and other specialties. However, ultrasound diagnosis presents unique challenges: image quality highly depends on operator technique, real-time interpretation requires immediate decision-making, image interpretation requires extensive training experience, and significant inter-observer variability exists.

Current AI-assisted medical imaging systems typically operate as isolated tools providing specific diagnostic suggestions without integration into broader clinical reasoning processes. The CORTEX approach addresses this limitation by providing a comprehensive clinical reasoning framework that integrates image analysis with broader medical knowledge and reasoning capabilities.

\section{Non-Visual Digital Twin Design}

The medical ultrasound case demonstrates a fundamentally different approach to Digital Twin representation compared to geometric models used in building monitoring or UAV exploration. This approach operates in high-dimensional feature spaces that capture essential diagnostic information from ultrasound images while enabling sophisticated reasoning about medical conditions and treatment options.
