\section{Cross-Domain Analysis and Comparative Assessment}

The comprehensive evaluation of the CORTEX cognitive architecture across three distinct application domains provides unprecedented insights into the generalizability, effectiveness, and practical applicability of LLM-Digital Twin integration for physical world decision-making. This cross-domain analysis reveals both universal principles and domain-specific requirements that shape the successful deployment of sophisticated cognitive architectures in real-world applications.

\subsection{Performance Comparison Across Domains}

Quantitative performance metrics across all three case studies demonstrate consistent and significant improvements in decision-making quality, operational efficiency, and safety performance compared to traditional approaches.
